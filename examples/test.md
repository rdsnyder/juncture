# Parse Test

However, realistically, John was also “rescued” by Elizabeth. In the early stages of their married life, Elizabeth would often illustrate scientifically accurate images of novelty bird specimens that John prepared for his customers [^6]. Her work promoted her taxidermist husband’s business, which widely expanded his career contacts and allowed him access to the country’s leading naturalists. Thus, in 1830, when presented with a collection of Himalayan bird skins, he proposed a grand idea. He thought to publish a subscriber-paid book to showcase hand-painted lithographs of these rare birds and sell them to affluent collectors and the aforementioned naturalists. It was an ambitious idea, and John knew that his artistic capabilities were limited at best. Elizabeth was more than capable, equipped with valuable education in the arts from her youth. Though it seemed she was initially sceptical of the proposal, as she asked her husband who would transfer the plates to the stones. To this question, John replied, "Why you, of course!" [^7] and thus the couple’s first publication was born.
